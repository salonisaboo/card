              <p>So no one told you life was gonna be this way
Your job's a joke, you're broke
Your love life's DOA(dead on arrival) 
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month
Or even your year, but

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
Cause you're there for me too </p>

I know it must be a super hard situation, because youâ€™re the strongest person I ever met Go easy on yourself, and rest as much as you can. You can only do as much as you can do, and some things are out of your control.</p>
